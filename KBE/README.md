### Description

### Evaluation

> I agree with Paul Graham's opinion on grading and exams. At this point of your scholarship, your focus should be on learning and self-improvement, not grades (or free time...).

> Each student must finish all 4 lab blocks to the satisfaction of the instructor teaching the lab block to get the "zapocet", a necessary pre-condition of the exam.

> Baseline grading is very simple - each of the labs is evaluated on the 25 point scale. Extra points for the activity during lectures and/or extra effort during labs are added on top. The sum is then converted to lab grade using the standard CTU metrics.

> Each student can then either accept the lab grade as hers/his grade for the course, or can volunteer for additional theoretical exam covering the theoretical part of the course. The resulting grade is then an average of the lab grade and the exam performance. Please, expect the (successful) exam to take at least 4-6 hours of work.

> We have no tolerance to people who get caught cheating - this is a security class after all. If you get caught cheating, you will be failed and reported to the FEE administration.
