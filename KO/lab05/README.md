Dear KO students,

let us provide you content for this week.

1) Lectures:
- The topic of lectures for this week is the Shortest Path Problem. For many of you, this might probably be a revision, but the purpose is to get a deeper understanding of the properties and applications of this problem. Do not be satisfied just with the fact that you can find some shortest route A -> B in a given graph.
- Please study lecture 4. (shortest paths) available at https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b192/courses/ko/start
- Focus on understanding why graphs (maybe with negative edges) but without negative cycles admit polynomial-time algorithms.
- Understand Bellman's optimality principle.
- We understand that having a video is always better. If you are interested, we recommend watching https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-e...s-problem/ , which covers the above two points.
- Revise the Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall algorithms. Understand why do they work and become comfortable performing iterations by hand if you are not.
- Try to formulate some of the examples as a Shortest Path Problem on a suitably defined graph.


2) Labs:
- For labs, we will continue practicing of ILP modeling.
- We have prepared for you three problems - Catering, Peaking power plants, and Settle up. One of them you might have already done in previous labs. Hence, try to formulate and code the ones that you did not.
- Problem statements, some input data, and expected results are available at https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b192/courses/ko/labs under week 5 - ILP 2.
- You are asked to upload the outcome of your work (in a .zip file) to the BRUTE upload system into an assignment corresponding this week. For us, this is the feedback that you can follow the problem set. Nevertheless, the assignment will not be graded (subject to change for future assignments).
- We have created a Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL...WEMq9w3t0J , where we will put some supplementary videos. We hope that the materials will help you in your studies. Note that this "feature" is still experimental. Your feedback is welcome.
- Continue working on HW1. Its deadline has been extended by one week.


3) Communication:
- You are encouraged to work (e.g., via Skype) on the labs' assignment with your colleagues. But remember, always try to be active and do your best. This is for you.
- This is a new situation for us, and we would like to make it work. Hence, if you will have any problems or question with the lecture content or assignments let us know via forum https://cw.felk.cvut.cz/forum/forum-1623.html
- We might consider running weekly live Q&A using some stream if you would be interested.

On behalf of KO team,

Antonin Novak.
